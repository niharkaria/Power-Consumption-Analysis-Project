## 💼 Business Impact & Recommendations

### **For City Planners**
- **Infrastructure Investment**: Zone 1 requires 30% additional capacity within 2 years
- **Load Balancing**: Implement demand response programs during 18:00-22:00 peak hours
- **Weather Preparedness**: Deploy emergency capacity when temperature forecasts exceed 35°C

### **For Power Grid Managers**
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance during low-consumption periods (04:00-06:00)
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement time-of-use pricing to reduce peak demand by estimated 15%
- **Renewable Integration**: Solar generation aligns well with afternoon consumption patterns

### **Cost Savings Potential**
- **Peak Shaving**: 10-15% reduction in peak demand could save $2-3M annually in infrastructure costs
